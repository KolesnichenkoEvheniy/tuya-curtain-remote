# Tuya API Project for ESP32

This project provides an example of how to control Tuya smart devices using the Tuya IoT API on an ESP32 board. It includes functionality for fetching access tokens and sending commands to devices.

## Features

- **Fetch Access Token**: Retrieves an access token from the Tuya API using client ID and secret.
- **Control Devices**: Sends commands to Tuya devices, such as setting the percentage of smart blinds.
- **Button Debouncing**: Uses the Bounce2 library to handle button presses without debouncing issues.
- **Configurable**: Allows for easy configuration of WiFi credentials and Tuya API settings through a separate `config.h` file.

## Requirements

- **ESP32 Board**: Compatible with ESP32 boards.
- **Arduino IDE or PlatformIO**: For compiling and uploading the code.
- **Tuya API Credentials**: Client ID, secret, and device ID from the Tuya IoT platform.
- **WiFi Connection**: Stable internet connection for API requests.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries (e.g., Bounce2, ArduinoJson) using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE.
3. Configure `config.h` with your WiFi and Tuya API credentials.
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the Serial Monitor for error messages.
- Ensure correct Tuya API credentials and WiFi settings.
- Verify that the device is properly connected to the internet.
